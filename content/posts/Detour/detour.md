Some major mistakes that I have made when trying to build muscle for the pass few year. I want to note them down here so as to remind myself not to make them again. Hopefully, the lessos I learnt can also help others who are facing similar situations.

I will try to keep update this post as I am still newbie and have very much to learn along the process. :wink:

### Why I Start Working Out and Bulking
I am typical ectomorphy; before I started working out since 2019, though I am 1.91m tall, I barely weigh 72Kg and looks extremely thin. I love play basketball. However, being so thin and weak in the past, I was always 'bullied' by the stronger players. Therefore, I decide to start working out to build more muscle and boost my strength

### Not Resting Enough
When I first started working out, I was extremely, or even excessively passionate about training. At that period, I trained six or even seven times a week! However, such frequency means that my body simply do not have enough time to rest and recover. Too much passion may backfire. :sob:

### Not Eating Enough Protein and Calories
In terms of diet, at first, I focus too much on eating 'cleanly' instead of the amount of protein and calories I take every. AS an ectomorphy trying to bulk, the first priority of mine should have been creating a sufficient calories surplus and protein (one gram of protein per KG of body weight) to maximize muscle growth.
