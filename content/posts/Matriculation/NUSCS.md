Check out this post to find out how did I get accept by NUS CS and receive the S&T Merit Scholarship. This post may be expecially applicable for international students study in Singapore.

### My Background
I am from China and I came to Singapore to study some 6 years ago under a government scholarship, MOE school-based scholarship (SM1 Scholarship), when I finished my secondary school in China. My secondary school is Xinmin Secondary School and my JC is Eunoia Junior College.

As far as I know, NUS might treat people from different background (Singaporeans, PRs, or International Students) quite different. Given my unique background, the information of this post may not be applicable to everyone but can be used as a reference

### My A Level Result
Rank Point: 88.75
- H1 General Paper              A
- H2 Mathematics    		A
- H2 Further Mathematics  	A
- H2 Physics 			A
- H2 China Studies in Chinese 	A
- H1 Project Work 		B
- H3 Mathmatics 		Merit

As shown by the official cutoff point of NUS Computer Science (AAA/A for 10th percentile and AAA/A for percentile), achieven 3 A for H2 subject and 1 A for H1 subject is a must to have. I have heard from my friend that she got acceptted to CS with 87.5 rank point with a C in General Paper.Therefore, don't worry too much if you are not so good at General Paper or have gotten a B for Project like me. :smirk:

### About My Scholarship
I received my offer to NUS CS around March 2021 and received the offer to Science and Technology Scholarship some two weeks later. I did not went through any interview nor fill any additional application form.  
##### Common Questions
Here are some questions that I am confused about when I tried to apply last year
1. Do I need Leadership Experience to get S&T Scholarship?
 * Not really, I did have much leadership position in JC other than subject reps.
2. Will there be a interview for the Scholarship?
 * As far as I know and the information I obtained from my senoirs, for people with 87.5 rank point and higher, NUS would offer S&T scholarship without interview, while  for peopel with rank point between 85 and 87.5, there will be an interview arranged.
