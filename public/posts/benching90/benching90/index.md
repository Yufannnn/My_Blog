# First Time Benching 90KG for 6 reps :muscle:

Nothing too much about this post, just a short post to celebreate and remember the day when I manage to bench 90KG for reps :muscle:

### Sad Backgroud Story
Due of the *pandemic, circuit breaker, and all kinds of the restrictions on gym usage*, I was not able training in a gym properly on a regular basis for the last one and a half years. :sob: I was barely able to maintain my strength for that period and my bench press performance was stuck at 80KG for 3 reps for more than  year, drifting me away from my goal of pressing 100KG for reps one day.

### Breakthrough of My BottleNeck
This year, with the alleviation of gym usage restrictions, I was finally able to train regularly as I used to. Although my body fat rate indeed somewhat increased (currently around 16%), my strength also improved tremendously. Today, I surprisingly managed to bench 90KG for 6 reps. Hopefully, my goal of benching 100KG some day is always around the corner! :sunglasses:
